# code_samples
samples and snippets from various projects

## Overview

This repo contains a few sample scripts and programs in Bash, Java, and Python taken primarily from assignments during my masters program.


## Bash samples

A series of scripts that build a synthetic voice using the Festival Speech Synthesis System developed by the Centre for Speech Technology Research at the University of Edinburgh. The voice is built by preforming unit selection on samples of pre-recorded speech.


## Java samples

An application that models the interactions between preditor and prey species in a two-dimentional landscape. Populations are modeled using partial differential equations that simulate birth and death rates over time based on configurable starting conditions. The purpose of this project was to practice clean coding habits such as object-oriented design, modularity, good unit testing coverage, and self-documenting code. This was a group project, so we also practiced collaborative development techniques and pair programming.


## Python samples

A couple of scripts created for my dissertation project, which investigated neural approaches to morphological segmentation. One script creates the training, development, and test datasets used during training from the Unisyn lexicon of English (also developed by CSTR at the University of Edinburgh). The other is an evaluation script that calculates word accuracy on the resulting predictions from a model given a gold standard.
